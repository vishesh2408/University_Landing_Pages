# Frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind)

Run locally:

```bash
cd "c:/Users/hp/Desktop/API and Landing Pages/university-landing/frontend"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build for production with `npm run build`.

This app expects the backend to be available at `/api` relative to the same host. For local development, you can run backend on port 4000 and use a proxy or run both under the same origin.
